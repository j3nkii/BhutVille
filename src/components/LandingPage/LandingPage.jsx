              I created this game out of pure nostalgia. I miss the old days of a long road trip, playing Zelda Oracle of Seasons.
              So i figured why not try and recreate one? This was a big stretch for myself since I didn't any experience with game design
              or development. Through this project I was introduced to Object Oriented Programing along with the concept of State Machines.
              I was also stretched for style design, since most of my past projects have not gone deep into prettifying. 
            <br></br><br></br>
              To get over these hurdles I had to heavily rely on the Phaser community as well as the Phaser Docs. Luckily the Docs were well
              written and the community is active! I also had the help of my Instructor as well as my cohort mates.
